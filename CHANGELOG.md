## [1.2.0] - 2021-09-03

### Changed

- Changed the expected format of data in the ``cray-product-catalog`` ConfigMap
  so that multiple Docker images can be associated with a single product
  version. Maintains backwards compatibility with previous ``cray-product-catalog``
  data format.
- Changed the behavior of the "activate" action from re-ordering group
  repository members to making the active product version's hosted repository
  the sole member of the group repository.

### Security

- Incremented version of Alpine Linux from 3.13.2 to 3.13.5 
  to address OpenSSL CVE-2021-3711.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-07-26

### Added

- Added the ability to remove entries from the product catalog on an uninstall.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-19

### Added

- Added ``sat_install_utility`` Python package with support for downgrade and
  uninstall by interacting with the container image registry and package
  repositories.
- Added ``Dockerfile`` for building a ``sat-install-utility`` image, and
  ``Jenkinsfile`` for building the image in a Jenkins pipeline.
